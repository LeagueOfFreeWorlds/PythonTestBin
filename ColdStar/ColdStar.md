# Description:
This program is a very basic text-based python game where the user has to decide the outcome of their quest...
The setting of this game is in the Oort cloud, thousands of astronomical units from Earth. Out in this deep expanse of
space, you are on a classified science mission living on a small icy body just a few kilometers in size. Resources are 
incredibly scarce, and so you have to rely on your drones to collect minerals and fight off pirates.
This is the resource breakdown:
- Iron - used for repairs and building more drones.
- Silicates - needed to build the computer modules for your drones.
- Alumina (aluminum dioxide) - Used for fueling redirectional thrusters to move your base.
- Water-ice - Used both as water supply to survive, as well as fuel for your drones (H2 + O2).
- Isotopes (uranium, thorium, actinium) - used for powering your base reactor.
- Organic compounds - used for synthesizing food.
## Introduction:
### Setting
You are an engineer that has recently been offered a very lucrative, but also dangerous job from the North American 
Space Administration (NASA analog). Your mission is to travel out to the outer edge of the solar system, into the Oort
cloud, and deploy undisclosed scientific equipment at a small base prepared in advance. You've been told that the 
mission codename is Operation Cold Star. The only thing you've been told about the purpose of this mission was to study
a mixture of observations, from deep space phenomena, to the human psyche. 
Unfortunately for you, all means of communication will be cut off after launch, and you will be on your own, traveling
to your destination in suspended sleep the course of 10 years, and surviving for another 5 years at the base with 
whatever you have.

### Objectives:
Survive 5 years at your base while the science equipment collects data. Build drones with iron and silicates, and
harvest local resources in order to prolong your existence. You will need to collect ice-water to drink and create
fuel and breathable air. You will need to collect isotopes to keep your base reactor running, in order to keep 
the base warm, lights on, and communications active with your drones. You've also got a food synthesizer, which can
turn organic compounds into edible food, but don't expect it to be gourmet...
### Finishing the game:
After 5 years of survival, you can return home, and finish the game. Or maybe you don't want to return home, and
maybe this is how you want to live, in which you can choose to continue playing until you run out of resources and die.

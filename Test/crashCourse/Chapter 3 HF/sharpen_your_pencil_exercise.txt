What implications are present for both versions of code that use logic to determine whether or not the code can run?
1. The if statement
The first code uses the os module (operating system), which is
used for trying to determine whether or not the file is present
within the working directory. If it isn't the if statement
will pass on to the else statement.
==============================================================
2. The try except method
The try except method is much more basic, which means that its
harder to fail. If the code fails to retreive the file in the
try method, the except will return an error that gives a
proper reason for failure.

Conclusion: 2 is better, because complexity is rarely a good
thing.

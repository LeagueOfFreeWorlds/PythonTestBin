For this assignment, you will be editing an existing script that contains a simple version of
Rock Paper Scissors. You will need to make the following changes:
- Change the name of the objects and how they interact (ie: squirt gun beats torch)
- Ask the user for their name and refer to them after each turn.
- Implement some sort of 'lives' system where the user can run out of attempts and also win
  more attempts.
- [Optional] make a way for the game to be won and/or lost.
- The script you will be editing imports the **random** module.

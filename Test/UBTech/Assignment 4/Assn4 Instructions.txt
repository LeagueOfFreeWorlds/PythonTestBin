Create a Python 3 script that asks the user to enter a first name and a last name.  The script should check to ensure the user has used only letters and that the first letter is capitalized.  A while loop must be used in your code, and you MUST have at least one instance of usage of the any() or all() functions.  You do not need to include code from previous assignments if unnecessary to the functions requested in this assignment.  Your script should only do what is asked for this assignment.  You may use a FOR LOOP for this assignment. You may not use METHODS for this assignment.
HINT: One solution involves the use of the len() function along with a while loop that contains a 'counter' that controls the number of times the loop runs.

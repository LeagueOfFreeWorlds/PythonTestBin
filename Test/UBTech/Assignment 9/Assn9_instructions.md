# Assignment Description:
Using the Python coding skills you have learned create a Python 3 script that asks the user for a single username, password (force to be 5 numbers),
firstname and lastname (force firstname and lastname to be all letters you do not need to worry about capitalization).  
The script should then put this information into a file using the file input/output (I/O) built into Python.  If you would like to learn about advanced file I/O capabilities that
Python has import the pickle module and try to  use that (read pickle's documentation!!) to accomplish this same assignment goals.
